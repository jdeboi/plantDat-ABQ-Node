    "bio": "Beautyberry, or French Mulberry, is very common in southeast Louisiana and important for our songbirds. The fruit is edible to humans and often gets spread by other mammals like deer, foxes, and squirrels. Used medicinally by indigenous communities and as a mosquito repellent. Research has revealed two compounds capable of deterring biting insects. A valuable shrub with many benefits that is happy in part shade or beneath larger trees.",

    "bio": "Here is an adaptable native sunflower that can take the heat and grow in front yards that don’t want to be lawns anymore. A great attractor of birds and pollinators, this tall annual is drought tolerant but likes it when it rains. An excellent choice for those spaces that receive a lot of sun as well as water, and would like more attention from the wildlife. Medicinally important to indigenous peoples and a source of natural dyes.",

A puffy white tail covered in tiny flowers emerges through the heart shaped leaves when ready to pollinate. A good choice for boggy shade areas with occasional or constantly standing water. This aquatic species assists with rainwater by creating infiltration spaces in dense soils with their root system. Less pumping, more planting!",
